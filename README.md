<h2>A Python-Programmed CLI Tool for quickly but not so safely storing Passwords in Text files.</h2>
<h2>Made by Rafell.</h2>
<h1>----- WARNING -----</h1>
<h1>Read the "LICENSE" File before you do anything, it has a disclaimer and a warning that can be boiled down to: I am not held liable for whatever things you do with this Software or any damages caused, but don't take this resumed version for truth! Go read the LICENSE!!</h1>
<h2>Why have you made this?</h2>
<h3>I don't know, don't ask me! It was intended to be a Python test.</h3>
<h2>What is going to happen to this "Project"?</h2>
<h3>Maybe it can get improved over the years, or maybe I can let it there as some relic of the past.</h3>
<h2>Should I use this to store my Passwords?</h2>
<h3>Very important ones? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Temporary ones? Maybe, but even still I would not recommend.</h3>
<h2>Can I contribute to this?</h2>
<h3>Uh?? Why? Ok, if you want to, you could at least better the way it keeps Passwords, but that's on you.</h3>
<h2>Is this Project abandoned?</h2>
<h3>Of course not, i'll probably return here to do a couple changes maybe.</h3>

<h1>Installation and use.</h1>
